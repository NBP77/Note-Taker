# Note-Taker
A fullstack application to help you take notes 

## Description

The main goal of this project was to connect the back-end to the front-end using express.js and a bunch of other tools
 
We were given the html and css along with the js so all we really needed to do was create a server file

This application is fully functional allowing you to create and save notes to a "database"

This app is also deployed on heroku

The starting page takes you to a notes page were you can upload notes

To check the project, I worked on click on these links:

Heroku: https://safe-wildwood-32276.herokuapp.com/ 

## Usage


Functional note entering and saving  

Can create a new note whenever you want 

If you click on a note then it shows up in the text area for you to review 

Easy UI for smooth organizing

Fully connected to a back-end 'server"

A great use of express.js

## Credits

I was able to do most of this based of the activities we have done in class.
